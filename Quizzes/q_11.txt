@ True
@ False*

$ A security company has purchased a system that will only allow certain (predefined) people to enter their building. The system includes a facial recognition system. Now the police are considering creating a system to monitor people who should be in isolation and this system will include the facial recognition system that is used by the security company. To which category of software reuse does this example belong to
@ Component Reuse*
@ Function Reuse
@ Library Reuse
@ Application Reuse
@ Object Reuse

$ What is incorrect regarding software testing processes and outputs
@ Software development methodology has no effect on the planning process and the conduct of the tests*
@ In the development state the unit tests are usually being performed by the developers
@ In a large system, the system testing process is multi-staged and includes Subsystem Integration tests of and System Intergration tests
@ Acceptance tests are being performed at the final stage of the testing process
@ In customer-adapted systems, acceptance tests are performed by or together with the customer's representatives

$ Which is correct regarding the relationship between Software Reuse and Dependability
@ Software reuse may cause problems with maintainability because maintainability requires flexibility to adapt to new environments and software reuse is not so flexible
@ Software reuse may cause problems with error tolerance because error tolerance requires software design so that there are no human errors, but in reuse there are always human errors
@ Software reuse may cause problems with survivability because survivability requires the ability to maintain dark-functionality under attack, and software reuse cannot work under attack
@ There is no relationship between the two
@ Software reuse may cause problems with repairability because repairability requires access to the source code and in somecases of reuse, there is no access to the source code*

@ False

$ One of the ways to add dependability to a software system is to include fault tolerance. The meaning of fault tolerance is to create protections in the code to handle improper user input
@ True
@ False*

@ True*
@ False

$ During the project planning phase by the project managers, the training costs are part of the project cost estimate
@ True*
@ False

$ What is the correct statement regarding scheduling in Agile methodology projects
@ Release planning is done before initial estimation
@ Task planning is done before release planning
@ Initial estimation is done before story identification
@ Release planning is done before iteration planning*
@ Task planning is done before story identification

$ Which statement is incorrect regarding the project schedule?
@ The disadvantage of an activity table is the difficulty of identifying relationships and dependencies between activities
@ In the Gantt [activity bar] chart, it is easy to identify whether there is flexibility in a certain activity schedule
@ In a Gantt [activity bar] chart, you can identify unrelated activities that can be performed simultaneously
@ In some forms of presentation of the project schedule there is no marking of milestones*
@ The activity network diagram shows a graph of dependencies between project activities

$ In project planning (creating a schedule), defining a clear endpoint that defines the end of a project activity is a necessary feature in defining a project activity
@ True*
@ False

$ Which statement is true about Software Testing processes and products
@ In terms of planning the tests, the product of the system design is an Acceptance Test Plan
@ An acceptance testing plan is used as an input to the system testing process
@ The test plan is planned from general to specific and the execution of the tests from specific to general*
@ The last step before implementing the systems is the system design
@ The test plans and test performance are always from the individual to the general

$ A Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is an example of "Commercial Off The Shelf" (COTS) of COTS-Solution type
@ True*
@ False

$ A disadvantage of Software Reuse can be that, sometimes, the cost and negative consequences of investing resources in the search and maintenance of external components can be greater than the cost of writing code ourselves
@ True*
@ False

$ What is not part of the Dependability Means software system
@ Reliability
@ Safety
@ Availability
@ Security
@ Usability*

$ Threats are part of the Dependability attributes of a software system
@ True
@ False*

$ Which statement is false in the context of a safety fault in a software system, in the Lufthansa plane crash in Warsaw, that was demonstrated?
@ The problem was caused by an error in the code (therefore the software did not work according to the system requirements specification)*
@ The safety component in the software prevented the pilots from recognizing that there was a change in the weather characteristics (such as wind direction) during the landing
@ The software did not recognize that the plane had landed and assumed that it was still in the air
@ Following the malfunction, the aircraft's braking system was not activated by the software
@ There was an error in the system requirements specification

$ Which of the charts is a graphical representation of the project schedule that best shows the relationships between activities and milestones in the project
@ Resource allocation chart
@ Activity network*
@ Gantt [activity bar] chart
@ None of the charts in other sections show the relationships between activities clearly
@ Spreadsheet

$ The Resource Allocation Chart is one of the charts that show the project phases (tasks) and the dependencies between them
@ True
@ False*

$ In the Project Planning Process, when you encounter a significant problem (which does not allow you to continue development according to the plan), it may not be necessary to stop the project and start a procedure of Risk Mitigation
@ True*
@ False

$ Project planning is carried out in three stages of the project life cycle: 
1. Proposal 
2. Startup 
3. Periodically throughout the project (periodic).  
In which of the stages is the project cost assessment carried out?
@ Only in the startup stage
@ Only in the proposal stage
@ Only in the proposal and startup stages
@ Only in the proposal and periodic stages
@ In all three*

$ Using frameworks like those of .Net or in Java is an example of Software Reuse in the Middleware Integration Frameworks category
@ True*
@ False

$ In a Customized Software Product, the acceptance testing program is coordinated with the customer and is based on the requirements specification coordinated with the customer
@ True*
@ False

$ Which of the following Software Reuse approaches emphasizes adapting a unified product for different customers
@ Software Product Lines and Application Frameworks
@ Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Application Frameworks
@ Software Product Lines and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
@ Application Frameworks and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

$ Software Reuse may result in inefficient use of experts
@ True
@ False*

$ In a Risk-Driven Approach, which of the following products is a result of Risk Reduction
