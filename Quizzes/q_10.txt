#Quiz 10

$ In a picture that is comprised of billions of objects, despite the fact that the overhead in building the hierarchy that is needed for the BVH (Bound Volume Hierarchy) algorithm is relatively high, it is still worth using this algorithm, because as a general rule, the
overhead will still be significantly less than the amount of time we will save by using this algorithm
@ True*
@ False

$ Which of the following statements most accurately describes BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)?
@ You do not need to use a tree data structure to implement this algorithm*
@ There is no need to circumscribe all of the bodies that are in the scene, together into just one box
@ If the ray intersects a geometry, we need to also check the geometry that is closest to the ray
@ There is no need to place individual objects (that are not part of a composite) inside the bounded box
@ In order to save the box that circumscribes the objects, we need to use 3 points (Point)

$ For the Regular Grid algorithm, it is necessary to implement the functionality of the CBR (Conservative Bounding Region) on the geometrical bodies, but we DON’T need to use the CBR in order to calculate the intersections between the ray and the geometrical bodies.
@ True*
@ False

$ One of the methods for acceleration that doesn’t (or almost doesn't) affect the quality of the picture is to reduce the number of pixels in the picture.
@ True
@ False*

$ Which of the following statements about Adaptive Supersampling is false?
@ Can be used whether the target area is created by using a grid or whether the target area is created by using stochastic (random) generated points
@ Hard to implement for target areas that are circular
@ It is relevant for only some of the picture enhancements that have used a beam of rays (aka relevant for only some of the super sampling algorithms that we learned in class)*
@ It is recommended to use recursion for calculations
@ If there is no major difference in the color of the rays in the beam then there is no reason to look at all of the samples

$ In a system, with one memory management component, in which the processors/cores use shared memory, when we use a fixed amount of threads (we will use threads in a "smart" way by making each thread calculate the color of an individual pixel, and of course have all of the threads work in parallel), the acceleration will be proportional to the amount of threads (and will not exceed the number of cores).
@ True
@ False*
